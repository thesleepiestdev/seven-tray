 Recreating older system tray icons in Windows 10/11.

Currently, only the volume icon has been recreated.
The basic idea is you can avoid tampering with system files and making your Windows install unstable by simply replacing the system tray icons with these programs.
Windows allows you to turn off the built-in versions of these icons (Settings > Personalization > Taskbar > Turn system icons on or off), allowing you to get around having to modify your OS to get the older versions of these simple icons!
If this is useful to even a single other soul I'll consider expanding on it and recreating more icons.
Enjoy!
